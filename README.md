The project was built by Obed Obeng-Gyasi
It built using the udacity Sublime code editor and tested on the 
Udacity inbuilt python environment

The project computes statistics on bicycle-sharing systems which allow users 
to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
 
It is a user interactive program which computes the statisticsbased on data
collected from chicago,new york city and washington  includes;

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination 
of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

References:
In the course of the project I did more practice locally and referred 
to codes written by others in similar project 
on github.
In understanding the dynamics I googled for info on other platforms 
such as Quora.
 
 Also opinions from friends who have undertook the course were sought
